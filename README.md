# The Kindling website

The Kindling website is powered by [Doks](https://getdoks.org).

## Development
### Prerequisites
Before building the website, please ensure you have installed the following dependencies:
- Git
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) â€” latest LTS version or newer
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

### Build
1. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/CloudDectective-Harmonycloud/website.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```
cd website && npm install
```
3. Start development server
```
npm run start
```
Doks will start the Hugo development webserver accessible by default at http://localhost:1313. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

### Fields, Files, and Folders
[filecoin-docs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs) is also a website powered by Doks. They have listed the detailed information about `What these fields, files, and folders use for`. Please check out their [docs](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs#files-and-folders) if you want to develop the Kindling website.
